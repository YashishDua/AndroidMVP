### What is MVP?
MVP stands for Model View Presenter and is one of the most widely used architecture while developing android applications.
MVP design pattern is a set of guidelines that if followed, decouples the code for reusability and testability. It divides the application components based on its role, called separation of concern.

This architecture creates three layers:

+ Model
+ View
+ Controller

Model is your database or data provider, View is the user interface, and Controller mediates View access to Model nad vice-versa.
